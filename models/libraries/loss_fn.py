    Computes the cross-entropy between two probabilities distributions.

    Input should be in logits.
    The difference to the typical crossentropy is that the target is assumed to
    be a probability distribution over the several classes (every class has
    some probability). Typical crossentropy assumes that only one class has all
    the probability distribution (i.e., target has a one-hot representation).

        input: (batch_size, num_classes): tensor of raw logits
